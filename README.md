# patchbay-thread

this module is the start of extracting some more generalised tools for threads in scuttlebutt

## TODO

Features:
- subject
- preview
- attachements
  - [ ] preview attachments option
  - [ ] drag and drop

More generally:
- decouple from patchcorePublish
- extract an attachment feature
- go refactor patch-inbox (which I've stollen a lot of this from) to use the results of this
- consider extracting some of the common tools in lib into modules
